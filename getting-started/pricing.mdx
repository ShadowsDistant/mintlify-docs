GradAI uses a credit based pricing system instead of a subscription. Credits can be purchased in packs, and cannot be purchased outside of packs. Each interaction with our AI services requires credits, although specific costs on each interaction vary.

  We currently offer only 5 credit packs. We do not sell credits outside of packs, nor do we sell specific amounts of credits.
